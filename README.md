This is the Github for the minecraft mod "TWISB Combat" 

Do you think minecraft combat lacks variety and that health regen from eating food is too strong, leading to drawn out fights? Well, this mod is for you!

TWISB Combat nerfs health regeneration from eating food and tweaks throwable potions and tridents to make them more useful in combat.

Health no longer regenerates very quickly when at full hunger. Instead, regeneration is always slow. The default vanilla regeneration can be re-enabled by setting the game rule "fastRegenFood" to true. Regeneration potions, and golden apples work as usual.

Splash and lingering potions can now be held down to throw them further, allowing you to hit enemies at range and decresing the risk of hitting yourself. They are much better in combat now!

Tridents have nearly doubled drop chance from Drowned and hit enemies from one block further. They are now a viable melee weapon, you might even prefer them to diamond/netherite swords in some cases!
